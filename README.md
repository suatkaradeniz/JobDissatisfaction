# Employee Exit Surveys: Analyzing Job Dissatisfaction
In this project, we investigate due to what reasons short time and long time employees resign and analyse the differences between two groups if any. The study is based on  two data sets both exit surveys conducted by  <span style="color:blue"> * The Department of Education, Training and Employment (DETE) </span> and <span style="color:blue"> * The  Technical and Further Education (TAFE) </span> institute in Queensland.  
    Mainly we look for answers to the following two question:
  *   Are employees who have only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about employees who have been at the job longer?
  * Is age a factor? Are younger employees resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about older employees?
  * Additionaly, we would like to know if there is a difference between institutions' job dissatisfaction proportions.
